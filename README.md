Introduction
============

These scripts were developed as part of an un-confrence session at the Analytics Camp held in
Chapel Hill, NC on February 25, 2012, described on this page as [http://wiki.analyticscamp.org/nc2011proposals](http://wiki.analyticscamp.org/nc2011proposals).

The scripts demonstrate how to pull data from the Google Analytics API to generate an RSS feed
of a website or blog's most popular pages, as well as creating a CSV file for further processing.

* During the presentation, the RSS feed was incorporated into a WordPress blog by using the RSS widget built into the theme I was using.
* Non-programmer analytics geeks also appreciated having their data in a spreadsheet so they could
do their magic.
* Bear in mind, the data these tools collect are only as good as your Google Analytics implementation.

The presentation is available at Slideshare at: http://bitly.com/gaapi2mpp?git

## Installation ##
This example code was provided in both Python and Perl.

* The Python example script is stand-alone and does NOT need the Perl example script nor its dependencies.
* The Perl example script is stand-alone and does NOT need the Python example script nor its dependencies.

Below are the installation instructions for each respectively:

### Python ###

The Python script requires the following libraries:

* [python-googleanalytics](https://github.com/clintecker/python-googleanalytics)
* [PyRSS2Gen](http://www.dalkescientific.com/Python/PyRSS2Gen.html)

You should be able to type in the following after checking-out the source:

Theoretically you should be able to type the following after checking out the source:

`sudo python setup.py install`

You can also just install using `easy_install` like so:

`sudo easy_install python-googleanalytics`
`sudo easy_install PyRSS2Gen`


### Perl ###

The Python script requires the following CPAN libraries:

* [Net::Google::Analytics](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Google-Analytics/)
* [Net::Google::AuthSub](http://search.cpan.org/~simonw/Net-Google-AuthSub-0.5/lib/Net/Google/AuthSub.pm)
* [XML::FeedPP](http://search.cpan.org/~kawasaki/XML-FeedPP-0.43/lib/XML/FeedPP.pm)

Installation is pretty straight forward:

`perl -MCPAN -e shell install Net::Google::Analytics Net::Google::AuthSub XML::FeedPP`

NOTE: 
You may encounter an error installing Net:Google::AuthSub in the form of a file 
permission error generated by ExtUtil::MakeMaker with regards to man page paths.

You'll want to see this page: 

* http://search.cpan.org/~leont/Module-Build-0.40/lib/Module/Build.pm
	
It explains how you can modify your ~/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm to modify makepl_arg arg.

Here's what mine looked like:

  `'makepl_arg' => q[PREFIX=~/perlmods INSTALLMAN1DIR=~/perlmods/share/man/man1 INSTALLSITEMAN1DIR=~/perlmods/share/man/man1 INSTALLMAN3DIR=~/perlmods/share/man/man3 INSTALLS
ITEMAN3DIR=~/perlmods/share/man/man3],`

On a personal note, Dreamhost doesn't seem to currently want to incorporate this directive from the MyConfig.pm file.


## Operation ##

Regardless of whether you're using the Perl or Python example scripts, you'll want to familiarize 
yourself with the arguments available on the Googl API 
[Dimensions & Metrics Reference](http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/dimsmets/dimsmets.html) page.

Also note that regardless of whether you run the Python or Perl example script, you'll need
to have access to a Google Analytics account, and have obtained a profile id 
(note, this is NOT the same thing as the ua-key).

The general syntax for both scritps is:
[script name] [gmail/username] [password] [ga profile id]

As discussed in the demonstration, the script is made so it can run regularly using crontab. 
The online '[visual crontab utility](http://www.corntab.com/pages/crontab-gui)' may provide assistance to 
thos individuals who can't always remember the cron syntax.

### Python ###

Below is the command-line syntax for running the Python example script:
<pre>
python ga-api2mpp.py username\@gmail.com password 1234567
</pre>

The script generates the follwing files:
* mpp-py.rss - a python generated RSS 2.0 compliant file of the top 20 most popular pages
* mpp-py.csv - a python generated tab-delimited file of all pages pulled from Google Analytics

### Perl ###

Below is the command-line syntax for running the Perl example script:
<pre>
perl ga-api2mpp.pl username\@gmail.com password 1234567
</pre>

The script generates the follwing files:

* mpp-pl.rss - a perl generated RSS 2.0 compliant file of the top 20 most popular pages
* mpp-pl.csv - a perl generated tab-delimited file of all pages pulled from Google Analytics


### Environments ###

Once the required libraries/modules are installed, I was able to run both script on the following platforms:

* Mac OS X 10.7
* Ubuntu 11.00
* CentOS 5
* Windows 7

Of course, your mileage may vary!
